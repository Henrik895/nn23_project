After several iterations of experimenting two main CNN architectures were chosen. Each category was trained using one of these archictectures. Models with pretrained weights for each category are stored in this folder - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12zU2YJRfyGOII4SEz5O-vD7zjgHFWPK9

To see in more detailed the training process of the first CNN architecture please refer to - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QS-Ntczrz2ny-mklKQEKnC9LkHy0R495, the second - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NdyBxLXG6N9vMGvbbnXJ35-gESttdxlS#scrollTo=N1dAV0fv0Z82
